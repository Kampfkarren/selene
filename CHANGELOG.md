## [0.4.3] - 2019-11-20
### Added
- Added `display-style` flag to use either rich (default), quiet (equivalent to -q), or JSON.

### Fixed
- Fixed a concatenated result always triggering an error when the standard library function expected a constant string (such as `collectgarbage` or `Instance.new`).
- Fixed parenthese conditions mixed with non-parenthese conditions (such as `(condition) and condition`) tripping the `parenthese_conditions` lint.

## [0.4.2] - 2019-11-13
### Fixed
- Fixed Roblox standard library not including structs, and thus failing when using `game`, `script`, etc.

### Fixed
- Fixed Roblox standard library not including Lua 5.1 globals the first time you ran selene.

## [0.4.0] - 2019-11-13
### Added
- A Roblox standard library can now be generated by simply having `std = "roblox"` in your configuration and running selene. If it does not exist, it will create one. This can also be initiated manually with `selene generate-roblox-std`.
- Added [`roblox_incorrect_color3_new_bounds`](https://kampfkarren.github.io/selene/lints/roblox_incorrect_color3_new_bounds.html).
- Added support for binary literals when using the `roblox` feature flag.

### Changed
- Changed incorrect_roact_usage to roblox_incorrect_roact_usage. [(#41)](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/issues/41)
- Changed parsing errors to produce prettier results.

## [0.3.0] - 2019-11-08
### Added
- Added `--color` option to specify whether colors could be used on the output.
- Added [`incorrect_roact_usage`](https://kampfkarren.github.io/selene/lints/incorrect_roact_usage.html) lint to verify correct usage of Roact.createElement.
- Added [`unscoped_variables`](https://kampfkarren.github.io/selene/lints/unscoped_variables.html) lint to disallow usage of unscoped (global) variables.

### Changed
- Colors will no longer be on by default when being piped. [(#32)](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/issues/32)

### Fixed
- Fixed false positive with `unused_variable` linting function declarations as only mutations. [(#30)](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/issues/30)
- Fixed terminal colors not resetting properly. [(#33)](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/issues/33)

## [0.2.0] - 2019-11-06
### Added
- Added standard library chaining. This means you can combine two standard libraries by setting `std` in selene.toml to `std1+std2`. You can chain as many as you want.

## [0.1.0] - 2019-11-06
