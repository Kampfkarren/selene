# Change Log

All notable changes to the "selene-vscode" extension will be documented in this file.

If you want to stay up to date with selene itself, you can find the changelog in [selene's CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Unreleased
- Fixed an issue where the extension wouldn't respect the config file's exclude paths.

- Fixed a bug where the extension would become unusable if it couldn't connect to the internet.
